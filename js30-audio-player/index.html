                <p class="info-song-text">Getting a message, a message from me<br>
                    I'm caught up in love and I'm in ecstasy<br>
                    What can I do now, when nothing's the same?<br>
                    And all that I know, I wanna do it again<br>
                    <br>
                    Well tell me now<br>
                    Life is so simple when you are with me<br>
                    'Cos when we're together I'm in ecstasy<br>
                    I'm in ecstasy, I'm in ecstasy, I'm in ecstasy<br>
                    <br>
                    Everybody go!<br>
                    <br>
                    All you pretty things get on board this mothership, I said<br>
                    All you've gotta be is ready for action baby<br>
                    <br>
                    Don't think I'm twisted, as a matter of fact<br>
                    Welcome you now to the second act<br>
                    Well I fought off robots and the men in the suits<br>
                    Wear off the soles of your monkey boots<br>
                    <br>
                    Well tell me know<br>
                    <br>
                    I can't get enough by the sunshine<br>
                    Can't get enough by the moonlight<br>
                    And all the colours that are coming on strong<br>
                    Trying to hold on, trying to hold<br>
                    <br>
                    Can't get enough by the oceans<br>
                    Can't get enough by the mantra<br>
                    All we will ever feel is ecstasy<br>
                    We're in ecstasy, we're in ecstasy, we're in ecstasy<br>
                    <br>
                    Everybody go!<br>
                    <br>
                    All you pretty things get on board this mothership, I said<br>

                    Well tell me know<br>
                    <br>
                    Can't get enough by the sunshine<br>
                    Can't get enough by the moonlight<br>
                    And all the colours that are coming on strong<br>
                    Trying to hold on, trying to hold<br>
                    <br>
                    Can't get enough by the oceans<br>
                    Can't get enough by the mantra<br>
                    All we will ever feel is ecstasy<br>
                    We're in ecstasy, we're in ecstasy, we're in ecstasy<br>
                    <br>
                    Everybody go!<br>
