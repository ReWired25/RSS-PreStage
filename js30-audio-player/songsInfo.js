let joywaveInfo = `"Obsession" is the third single from Joywave's album Possession. The song is about finding a consuming distraction from one's mental state. Just as obsessions can be hard themselves, Joywave is implying that picking and choosing is the only way to avoid breaking down.`

A new obsession<br>
<br>
There's something<br>
Lurking in the back of my mind<br>
And lately<br>
I feel it sliding into the light<br>
<br>
I just need something<br>
To get me through the night, oh<br>
A new obsession<br>
Something to hold in my sights<br>
(Something to behold in my sights)<br>
I just need something<br>
To get me through the night, oh<br>
A new obsession<br>
Something to hold in my sights<br>
(Something to behold in my sights)<br>
<br>
Sometimes<br>
I feel it comin’ on at the wheel<br>
Distraction<br>
Is the only thing keeping me sealed from breaking<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I just need something<br>
To get me through the night, oh<br>
A new obsession<br>
Something to hold in my sights<br>
(Something to behold in my sights)<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
I just need something<br>
To get me through the night, oh<br>
A new obsession<br>
Something to hold in my sights<br>
(Something to behold in my sights)<br>
I just need something<br>
To get me through the night, oh<br>
(To get me through the night, to get me through the night)<br>
I just need something<br>
Obsession (Obsession, obsession, obsession)<br>
Something to hold in my sights`

I know you<br>
I know you<br>
I know you don't think about that so<br>
Go take your chance<br>
Put your money where your mouth is<br>
I just wanna dance<br>
And if it takes a little time<br>
To go slow, go red, go wild<br>
Yeah believe me I've been trying<br>
Since I was a little child<br>
Could you come to me?<br>
<br>
Could you come to me so naturally<br>
Like a fox into the night?<br>
And where foxes go I too will roam<br>
If that's alright<br>
It must be hard, you're being so statuesque<br>
People just wanna look<br>
But you put all these things back to bed when<br>
You kick off your shoes<br>
<br>
Priestess, priestess<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance<br>
When, priestess, priestess<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you dance<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance<br>
<br>
Who made you<br>
Who made you<br>
Who made you so clear and strong<br>
Cut from clay and stone?<br>
Electricity flows through your spine and it shows<br>
In the night when we're alone<br>
It must be hard, you're being so statuesque<br>
People just wanna look<br>
But you put all these things back to bed when<br>
You kick off your shoes<br>
<br>
When, priestess, priestess<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance<br>
When, priestess, priestess<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance<br>
<br>
Yeah, priestess, priestess<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance<br>
When, priestess, priestess<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you dance, you dance<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance<br>
You dance, you dance, you dance, you dance`

let districtsLyrics = `
I rose a statue over cheap regrets<br>
I put my head into my hands<br>
I rose a statue for the things I said<br>
Tongue twisting, head into my hands<br>
<br>
I didn’t know what a mirror was<br>
‘Til I went to LA -<br>
Jacuzzis, an uzi, and a Land Rover ride<br>
That’s what the money’s for<br>
Bikinis, Bellinis, and paté<br>
<br>
And in the country we’re just burning up too<br>
The weakest link’s just a drain on the food<br>
And if it’s better being left on it’s own<br>
Let’s prod it like cattle<br>
<br>
I didn’t know about glory ‘til firsthand in New York<br>
I saw the smut and the fury and the dregs of the earth<br>
But let me show you what a mirror does<br>
It’s now one and the same -A little bit of nothing, and a whole lot of fame<br>
<br>
Spaced out for free and made friends in the dives<br>
Nothing’s ever the same, nothing’s ever quite right.The image is for certain<br>
But the present always dies,So I’m going out to make it something sacred<br>
<br>
I rose a statue over cheap regrets<br>
I put my head into my hands<br>
I rose a statue for the things I said<br>
Tongue twisting, head into my hands`

Mr P and his three-faced embassy<br>
Walk hand in hand to a human parliament<br>
Chanting, ‘we got qualms with the rich<br>
Qualms with the ill, qualms with the poor.'<br>
Chanting, ‘we got qualms with the young<br>
Qualms with the old, qualms with the poor.’<br>
<br>
To murmured agreement<br>
<br>
The house sat, struck still<br>
In silent attentive frenzy until:<br>
<br>
‘Throw your arms,' he says, ‘up in an ecstasy<br>
And dance, white men, dance and repeat after me:<br>
It's now law that: one equals two<br>
One equals three, one equals four<br>
Now you’re getting it!<br>
Praise unto me and let it be seen<br>
I am your Lord.'<br>
<br>
‘But what do we call you?'<br>
Came the voice of the interlocutor<br>
<br>
‘One, one, one, one call me Inspiration!'<br>
<br>
Inspiration! Praise the name<br>
Inspiration! You came again<br>
Mr P's six hundred and fifty-three faced embassy<br>
Dance, dance, dance up to the edge of the sea<br>
<br>
‘To hurl yourself,' he proclaims, ‘off the promontory<br>
Is to take my name in a meaningful reverie.'<br>
A dissenter shouts, ‘wait a second<br>
We're not the young, we’re not the old, we’re not the poor<br>
Anyway, my arm's getting sore<br>
One, two, three, four let’s all go home.'<br>
Mr P was left alone<br>
<br>
‘Say what? Come again<br>
Say what? Come again<br>
Say what? Come again<br>
I'm Inspiration<br>
But I came again<br>
But I came again<br>
But I came again<br>
No one want some inspiration?'<br>
<br>
Mr P is left stranded on a coastal jut of white rock<br>
With Jesus, Zeus and a handful of sun gods<br>
Waiting, watching as the tide rolls in<br>
<br>
Going down into culture, drowning in and under all the culture<br>
Going down, going down, into the sea, drowning in all this eternity<br>
If the earth feels small, throw yourself from a high wall<br>
And watch as the ground grows tall<br>
<br>
‘We’re dropping like flies, what's the plan?<br>
Look up boys, see what we could've won.'<br>
<br>
As we live, so we die, give it time<br>
Take the coins off your eyes, none survive<br>
Men are words, lives are lines, allay a life<br>
As we live as we die, no one needs us to survive<br>
As we live so we die, no one needs us to survive<br>
Take the coins off your eyes, no one needs us to survive<br>
Men are words, lives are lines, no one needs us to survive<br>
And we live then we die, no one needs us to survive<br>
<br>
Inspiration! Praise the name<br>
Inspiration! You came again`

Getting a message, a message from me<br>
I'm caught up in love and I'm in ecstasy<br>
What can I do now, when nothing's the same?<br>
And all that I know, I wanna do it again<br>
<br>
Well tell me now<br>
Life is so simple when you are with me<br>
'Cos when we're together I'm in ecstasy<br>
I'm in ecstasy, I'm in ecstasy, I'm in ecstasy<br>
<br>
Everybody go!<br>

All you pretty things get on board this mothership, I said<br>
All you've gotta be is ready for action baby<br>
<br>
Don't think I'm twisted, as a matter of fact<br>
Welcome you now to the second act<br>
Well I fought off robots and the men in the suits<br>
Wear off the soles of your monkey boots<br>
<br>
Well tell me know<br>
<br>
I can't get enough by the sunshine<br>
Can't get enough by the moonlight<br>
And all the colours that are coming on strong<br>
Trying to hold on, trying to hold<br>
<br>
Can't get enough by the oceans<br>
Can't get enough by the mantra<br>
All we will ever feel is ecstasy<br>
We're in ecstasy, we're in ecstasy, we're in ecstasy<br>

Everybody go!<br>

Ready for action baby,<br>
